Difference between Window and Document Object
              Window Object Model:
                          => Syntax of Window Object:
                                        window.propertyname;
                          => It represent the browser window in which we are seeing the content.
                          => The properties related to it are stored in the window object.
                          => It is loaded before the document because window container document.
                          => The window is the global element for all objects,functions, etc.
                          => It is an object of the browser.
                          => We can access document object properties inside properties inside the window.
                          => example:
                                  window.document.title
                                           it will return the title of the document 
                          => logically:
                                window:{
                                    document:{properties}
                                }
                          
                Document Object Model:
                            => Syntax of Document Object:
                                          document.propertyname (or) window.document.propertyname          
                            => It represents the document loaded inside the window or browser.
                            => The properties related to it are stored in the document object.
                            => It is loaded after the loading window because the window contains a document.
                            => It is the root element of the document object model.
                            => It is an object of window.
                            => We can not access windows objects properties inside the document.
                            => example:
                                   document.title
                                            it  will return the title of the document.
                            => logically:
                                  document:{
                                    properties
                                  }
